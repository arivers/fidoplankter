# Overview

This is the code repository for a web application to help biologists culture
marine phytoplankton under iron-limiting conditions. In these experiments the
iron concentration in the media is held constant by the chelator EDTA, which buffers the metal concentration in a manner similar to a pH puffer.

Unfortunately, phytoplankton can begin to remove un-chelated iron from
the media faster that it is replenished by dissociation from the FeEDTA
complex, causing the concentration of un-chelated (free) iron to decrease. This
calculator estimates the maximum cell density that a culture medium can support.
